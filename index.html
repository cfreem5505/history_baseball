<h2><li>Early History of the MLB</li></h2> 
    <p>Major League Baseball (MLB) is a professional baseball organization, the oldest of the four major professional sports leagues in the United States and Canada.
        Major League Baseball has been around for about 149 years beginning in 1869. The Cinncinati Reds were the first team founded in that year.  A total of 30 teams 
        play in the National League (NL) and American League (AL), with 15 teams in each league. The NL and AL were formed as separate legal entities in 1876 and 1901
        respectively. After cooperating but remaining legally separate entities beginning in 1903, the leagues merged into a single organization led by the Commissioner
        of Baseball in 2000. Founded on February 2, 1876, to replace the National Association of Professional Base Ball Players (NAPBBP) of 1871â€“1875, 
        (often called simply the "National Association"), the NL is sometimes called the Senior Circuit, in contrast to MLB's other league, the American League of Professional
        Base Ball Clubs ("American League"), which was founded 25 years later. Both leagues currently have 15 teams.</p>
